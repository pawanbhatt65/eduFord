      <p>Washington, officially the State of Washington, is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the Western
        United States. Named for George Washington—the first U.S. president—the state was made out of the western part
        of the Washington Territory, which was ceded by the British Empire in 1846, in accordance with the Oregon
        Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute. The state—which is bordered on the west by the
        Pacific Ocean, Oregon to the south, Idaho to the east, and the Canadian province of British Columbia to the
        north—was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital; the state's largest
        city is Seattle. Washington is often referred to as Washington state to distinguish it from the nation's
        capital, Washington, D.C.</p>
